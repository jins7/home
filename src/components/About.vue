          I am currently pursuing my PhD at the University of Science and Technology of China as part of the Lab of Data Intelligence. In collaboration with my peers, junior students, and researchers, we are dedicated to advancing the field of deep learning and artificial intelligence by enhancing the trustworthiness, interpretability, generalization, and robustness of algorithms. My research primarily focuses on graph-structured applications, delving into areas such as sparsification (including pruning, compression, and condensation), data mining (with an emphasis on spatio-temporal forecasting and Earth Science), and AI applications in biochemistry (I'm learning about it), such as molecular property prediction. My work has been published in top-tier conferences and journals like ICLR, NeurIPS, ICML, KDD, AAAI, WWW, TKDE, and TPAMI, with over 15 papers as the first author or corresponding author. Additionally, I have had the honor of serving as a reviewer for leading conferences and journal including ICLR, KDD, NeurIPS, ICML and TKDE.
